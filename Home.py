## 🚀 What is PhysiKit?
PhysiKit is a modular, open-source platform for simulating and visualizing physical systems. You can:
- Run interactive simulations (Spring-Mass, Double Pendulum, and more)
- Visualize results with scrollable, zoomable graphs
- Download simulation data for analysis
- Easily add new systems and features
